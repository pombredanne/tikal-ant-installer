Build Types README

The build type directory is a series of examples and test run using AntInstaller

Various features are tested and are provided here to serve as examples

if the sub-directory contains a directory called "build" an Ant build 
typically build-demo.xml must be run prior to running the test which will
create files in the "artifacts" directory
